I am excited to announce that my paper, "Understanding Children's Reading Patterns and their Associations with Learning Outcomes Using Machine Learning Techniques," has been accepted for presentation at the Society for Research in Child Development conference in 2023. I am looking forward to meeting you in Salt Lake City.

I received Master's Student Award for Research and Academic Excellence in the Stanford Graduate School of Education.
