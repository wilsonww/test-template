I am a second year [Education Data Science Master](https://ed.stanford.edu/eds) student at [Stanford Graduate School of Education](https://ed.stanford.edu/). I am fortunate to have professors [Phil Fisher](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/philf), [Nick Haber](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/nhaber), [Roy Pea](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/roypea), and [Mark Warschauer](http://markwarschauer.com/) as my advisors. My research focuses on the use of computer vision and artificial intelligence to promote positive parent-child interactions (Project: [Filming Interactions to Nurture Development](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/innovation-application/innovation-in-action/find/)). Additionally, I am interested in using innovative technologies, such as large language models, to enhance STEM learning (Project: [MathyAI](https://mathyai.netlify.app/)) and improve the well-being of caregivers. My ultimate goal is to empower young learners to reach their full potential and improve their lives through learning.

Before joining Stanford, I received my bachelor's degree with a double major in [Pure Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/major-and-minor-programs/pure-mathematics.html) and [Communication & Media](https://lsa.umich.edu/comm) from the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/). I worked on Michigan early childhood policy analysis in the [Education Policy Initiative](https://edpolicy.umich.edu/) (PI: [Professor Brian Jacob](http://www.brian-jacob.com/) and [Professor Gloria Yeomans-Maldonado](https://med.uth.edu/pediatrics/faculty/gloria-yeomans-maldonado-phd/)), gameful learning analysis of [GradeCraft](https://gradecraft.com/) (PI: [Professor Barry Fishman](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/barry-fishman)) and Google image search algorithm biases analysis in the [Center for Ethics, Society and Computing](https://esc.umich.edu/) (PI: [Professor Christian Sandvig](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csandvig/)).
